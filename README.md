Created two separate programs. One for the customer and the other for the Manager to use.

The customer has the options to:

1. look up all the items in our inventory,
2. purchase a product

pretty straightforward.

in the manager program, the user has the option to:

1. view the products for sale
2. view low inventory
3. add to the inventory
4. add a new product
